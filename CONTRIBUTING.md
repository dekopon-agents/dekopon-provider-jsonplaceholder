Keep the provider closed and deterministic:

- normal dependencies must remain exact crates.io pins; no path or Git sources;
- build only `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (never `wasm32-wasip2`);
- add no transport, URL authorization library, WASI, JS, subprocess, runtime networking, or ambient
  host capability;
- never commit `.wasm`, checksums, `dist/`, or `target/`;
- keep every public failure fixed and secret-free;
- regenerate and review the isolated normal/build graph in `security/wasm-dependencies.txt` and the
  checksum-verified, self-contained `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` bundle after a lock change.

Before opening a change, run the complete acceptance command block in `README.md`. Tests use native
mocks or loopback listeners only and must never depend on the public network.
